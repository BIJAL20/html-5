<h2> Question 4: Canvas and SVG tags</h2>
<h2>Answer:</h2>
<h2>canvas  Element:</h2>
<p>The &lt;canvas&gt; element provides a way to draw graphics, animations, and interactive content using JavaScript. <br> It works by creating a bitmap-based drawing surface, allowing you to manipulate individual pixels to create various graphical effects. <br>
  <ul style="background-color: gray;" align="left">
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="400" height="200"></canvas> <br>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Svg  Element:</h2>
<p>
  The  &lt;svg&gt; (Scalable Vector Graphics) element is used to create vector graphics. <br> Unlike  &lt;canvas&gt; SVG is based on XML and represents graphics as a collection of vector shapes, which makes it resolution-independent and suitable for static or interactive graphics. 
  <ul style="background-color: gray;" align="left">
  <br> Here's a simple example: <br>
  <svg width="400" height="200">
    <circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50" fill="blue" />
    <rect x="200" y="50" width="100" height="100" fill="green" />
  </svg>
</ul>
